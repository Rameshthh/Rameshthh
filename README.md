**Project Title: A* Algorithm Implementation**

**Description:**
This project is an implementation of the A* algorithm, a widely used pathfinding algorithm in computer science and artificial intelligence. A* is particularly efficient in finding the shortest path between two points on a graph or grid while considering the cost of traversal and a heuristic estimation of remaining distance to the goal.

**Features:**
- **Efficient Pathfinding:** A* efficiently finds the shortest path between two points on a graph or grid.
- **Heuristic Function:** Utilizes a heuristic function to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal node, improving efficiency.
- **Customizable:** The implementation allows customization of heuristic functions and cost functions to adapt to different problem domains.
- **Visualization:** Includes visualization tools to demonstrate how the algorithm traverses the graph or grid, aiding in understanding its operation.
  
**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
